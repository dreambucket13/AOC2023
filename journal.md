# Advent of Code 2023 Notes

## Day 5, part 2

My part 2 solution (starting from location 0 and backtracing until I find the first location with a valid seed) is quite slow.  Look into this solution, using ranges and unions of said ranges.
This is not a problem I have seen before so this solution type could be interesting.

## Day 6

I was told there would be no math.

## Day 8

The key to part 2 is recognizing that the sequences all repeat.  So, finding the least common multiple is where they meet.

## Day 10

- write visual debugging tools with color
- If the algorithm seems very convoluted, it probably is
- Still, I am not 100% confident that the solution is general enough.  It passes the tests but I am not quite sure of the L, J logic.
