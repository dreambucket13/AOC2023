# Advent of Code 2023 Notes

## Day 5, part 2

My part 2 solution (starting from location 0 and backtracing until I find the first location with a valid seed) is quite slow.  Look into this solution, using ranges and unions of said ranges.
This is not a problem I have seen before so this solution type could be interesting.
